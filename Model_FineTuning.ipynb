        "Fine-tuning refers to the process of taking a pre-trained language model and retraining it for a different but related task using specific data. This approach is also known as transfer learning, which involves transferring the knowledge learned from one task to another. Large language models (LLMs) like Llama 2 7B are trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data and can be fine-tuned on domain domain datasets, making the model perform better on that specific domain.\n",
